Counted per agent. If a machine with 2 neighbors has a single faulty neighbor, it will get an additional failing probability of p_fail_bonus/2. If the same machine has one faulty neighbor and one dead neighbor, it will get a penalty of p_fail_bonus/2 + p_dead_bonus/2.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"#MultiAgentSysAdmin.MachineState","page":"MultiAgentSysAdmin","title":"MultiAgentSysAdmin.MachineState","text":"status: {good, faulty, dead}\nload: {idle, loaded, success}\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"#POMDPs.gen-Tuple{MultiAgentSysAdmin.AbstractSysAdmin{false}, Any, Any, Any}","page":"MultiAgentSysAdmin","title":"POMDPs.gen","text":"Basically, the only way we can get reward is by:\n\nStarting from the Load state (since it's the only one that can complete)\nDoing action 0;\nAnd ending up in the Done state.\n\ndead machine increases the probability that its neighbors become faulty and die system receives a reward of 1 if a process terminates successfully status is faulty, processes take longer to terminate If the machine dies, the process is lost.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"}]
